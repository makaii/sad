#### BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY

Based on the National Baseline Survey on Financial Inclusion by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), only 4 out of 10 Filipino adults (43.2%) have savings, 32.3% used to save in the past but have stopped saving money while the remaining 24.5% have never experienced saving money. 

The possible reasons why few have savings are because of low salary, covered expenses, debts, or simply because of poor financial management. Hardly a day after people received their salary they already have a hard time keeping track where the money was spent. And by the end of the day, no money was set aside for savings. The effect of this can cause problems whenever tragedy strikes such as accidents and sudden illness. 

One way to keep track of the money is to list down all of the expenses on a piece of paper. However, there’s a tendency that the paper will be lost and that after some time, the paper will take too much space. It will also take some time before searching a specific expenditure. 

With the help of a computer, The Wealth Management System is a proposed system that can be used by everyone which aims to keep track of the net income and expenditures in an easier and faster way through the use of web application. The user will create a secured account where the user can enter the monthly net income and decide whether to enter the specific expenditures such as food, transportation and rent daily or monthly. Using the data entered by the user, the system will compute how much is left and can be set aside for savings. 

There may also be times that people forget to pay for the bills and debts. But with the Wealth Management’s Reminders feature, it will no longer be a problem. The user can set the date, amount and for what payment it is. On the date entered, the user will receive a reminder about it. 

Another feature of the system is the Progressive Saving. An example of this is the 52-Week challenge where the amount of money that must be saved increases for every succeeding week until on the 52nd week. After the system computes how much money is left, the user can set the numbers of week for the savings. Then the system will compute how much the increase for every week. In this way, people can break and track down where the money was spent and also helps them see the goal amount they have set.

The system will also show reports for every transaction made and graphs that will help the user identify which category of expenses did the money goes the most. This will help monitoring the money better. All in all, the Wealth Management System dismisses the need to use paper and pen, organizes the list, summarize the expenses, reduces errors and helps the user budget the money effectively.
	
#### OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY

The general objective of this study is to develop a web-based Wealth Management system that can help anyone to budget and save money.

This study specifically aimed to:

1.	Design a Wealth Management System that has the following features:
	*	Security of the system
	*	Sign up and Log in for the privacy of the user
	*	Graphs that will show the rate of money allotted to different expenses
	*	Reminders for scheduled payments or accounts payables
	*	Comment box to help improve the system
	*	Progressive saving that will help the user save money every week for a specific length of weeks.
2.	Create an application utilizing the following:
	*	Latest version of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Material design for the web design
	*	PHP for web programming language
	*	MYSQL for the database management system
	*	XAMPP as the server and database connection provider
	*	Adobe photoshop for creating icons, buttons and image editing
3.	Test and improve the system developed based on:
	*	Security- User’s personal information must be secured and will not be accessed by anyone other than the user and the admin.
	*	Accuracy – computations and graphs must be correct

#### SCOPES AND LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY

The study covers two methods on saving money such as tracking the expense and progressive saving. A website that prioritize the security of the User and can only be used after signing up or logging into the account. Create graphic presentations of expenses and savings weekly or monthly to help the user to track the money. Reminders for the scheduled bills and Comment box to help us gather opinions from the users to improve our website.

The Progressive Saving covers the tracking of the money to be saved to achieve a particular goal amount and to compute how much the increase for every week.
